    "Due to the current policy of SLURM schedulers to charge the full allocated time to the account fairshare (regardless of timeout), it is a good idea to refurbish the slurm scheduler to adopt a \"take and hold\" approach to O2 resources since you get penalized for time that you request but do not use making allocation of resources later in the day (after running one or two steps) more difficult.\n",

    "- More sophisticated memory clearing of the dask_controller object (total memory clearing without a restart that leads to crashes) THIS FIRST \n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the entire `TrenchRipper` pipline, divided into simple steps. This pipline is ideal for Mother <br>Machine image data where cells possess fluorescent segmentation markers. Segmentation on phase or brightfield data <br>is being developed, but is still an experimental feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in this pipeline are as follows:\n",
    "1. Extracting your Mother Machine data (.nd2) into hdf5 format\n",
    "2. Identifying and cropping individual trenches into kymographs\n",
    "3. Segmenting cells with a fluorescent marker\n",
    "4. Determining lineages and object properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step, the user will dynamically specify parameters using a series of interactive diagnostics on their dataset. <br>Following this, a parameter file will be written to disk and then used to deploy a parallel computation on the <br>dataset, either locally or on a SLURM cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended as an end-to-end solution to analyzing Mother Machine data. As such, **it is not trivial to plug data <br>directly into intermediate steps**, as it will lack the correct formatting and associated metadata. A notable <br>exception to this is using another program to segment data. The library references binary segmentation masks using <br>only metadata derived from their associated kymographs. As such, it is possible to generate segmentations on these <br>kymographs elsewhere and place them into the segmentation data path to have `TrenchRipper` act on those <br>segmentations instead. More on this in the segmentation section..."
