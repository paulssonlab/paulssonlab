    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the entire `TrenchRipper` pipline, divided into simple steps. This pipline is ideal for Mother <br>Machine image data where cells possess fluorescent segmentation markers. Segmentation on phase or brightfield data <br>is being developed, but is still an experimental feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in this pipeline are as follows:\n",
    "1. Extracting your Mother Machine data (.nd2) into hdf5 format\n",
    "2. Identifying and cropping individual trenches into kymographs\n",
    "3. Segmenting cells with a fluorescent marker\n",
    "4. Determining lineages and object properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step, the user will dynamically specify parameters using a series of interactive diagnostics on their dataset. <br>Following this, a parameter file will be written to disk and then used to deploy a parallel computation on the <br>dataset, either locally or on a SLURM cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended as an end-to-end solution to analyzing Mother Machine data. As such, **it is not trivial to plug data <br>directly into intermediate steps**, as it will lack the correct formatting and associated metadata. A notable <br>exception to this is using another program to segment data. The library references binary segmentation masks using <br>only metadata derived from their associated kymographs. As such, it is possible to generate segmentations on these <br>kymographs elsewhere and place them into the segmentation data path to have `TrenchRipper` act on those <br>segmentations instead. More on this in the segmentation section..."
