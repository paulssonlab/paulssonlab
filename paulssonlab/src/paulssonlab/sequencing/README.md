# Sequencing workflows

Snakemake workflows for analyzing Illumina/nanopore sequencing data. The following use-cases are planned:
1. Whole-plasmid sequence verification with Illumina (e.g., through the MGH DNA core), pooled and non-pooled
2. Whole-plasmid sequence verification with ONT Flongle, both with barcodes and pooled (without barcodes)
3. FISH-barcoded amplicon sequencing with ONT MinION/PromethION

## Usage

TODO.
