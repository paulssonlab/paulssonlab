### TODAY
locally make df with trench points, bbox; another df with diag
profile/optimize get_trenches
make trench points df with dask
get per-timepoint, per-trench focus locally
per-trench focus with dask
dask frame quality
switch to PSD instead of discrete_periodogram, find period+offset using intensity hough??
multichannel_image_viewer

### POSTPONED
pandas local/dask runner+combiner for both frame quality/trench finding
dask trench-wise processing for trench-wise focus df

groupby/max group size for the above

mask out found trenches, compute mean intensity/PSD for masked frames as another debris check
    how to find debris that intersects with trenches? does this work?
calculate azimuthally-averaged PSD, throw out images with bright low-frequency debris

easy dask re-running of trench detection on bad_angle frames
    function to re-run dask (OR LOCAL?) on a dataframe
        by making gather a pass-through (?), map_futures with max_level=1 so we don't recurse super deep
        OR just use local cluster for local testing?
    can use this to throw out out-of-focus frames
    (join dataframe with focus, debris indicators, find appropriate cuts)
    functions that make it easy to group tasks (arbitrarily?) with a flag
        groupby (filename, position) and max group size, submit grouped jobs, then merge results dict (keyed by index) upon gather
switch to PSD instead of discrete_periodogram, find period+offset using intensity hough??

debug period-finding errors
debug failures (make function to collect failures as dataframe to send to frame_stream)
can I fix workload balancing issues by grouping tasks??
submit workload balancing dask.distributed issue
    starved workers at the end of get_trenches
    task serialization (wrapped_diagnostics_to_dataframe)
    update priority: so that wrapped_diagnostics_to_dataframe run+transfer ASAP

### TOMORROW
run charles segmentation locally on one frame stack framewide
then trenchwise
run my segmentation locally on one frame stack trenchwise
run my trench detection+segmentation using dask

### TRENCH DETECTION POLISH
defaultdict which can filter out hv.ViewableElements so we don't waste memory on plots we'll never pull down
    benchmark how long constructing holoviews objs takes vs. no holoviews objs for get_trenches_diag
    benchmark how long it takes to pickle+pull down from a worker vs. re-run get_trenches locally
refine rotation using trench ends and RANSAC (if necessary??)
use 1px*sec(theta) spacing for trench region slices?? (or is there a cleaner way? this is basically just a rotation without interpolation)
intensity hough on hessian k2
OR upsample before intensity hough
change angle bounds to +/-40deg (weird aliasing at exactly 45deg)
run periodicity detection on componentwise normalized image with ALL components, not just selected trench set?

### NEXT
run charles segmentation locally on one frame stack
run my trench detection+charles segmentation using dask
do the same for charles phase segmentation, compare with fluorescence
trench finding in phase
corrupted nd2 reader

### AFTER
my trench detection in phase+charles phase segmentation using dask
first cut of tracking using integer programming (given a good segmentation)
tracking+segmentation

### AFTER UI POLISH
show_plot_browser should work for singleton keys [i.e., single plots] (and make that work correctly with streams)
feasibility of running regrid off a remote image stored on a worker (is there a way to hook up bokeh to connect directly to worker?)
synchronize show_plot_browser StreamXY [exclude specially-tagged images?]
trench_image_viewer, cell_image_viewer: plot trench/cell outlines, accept arbitrary callbacks that return (possibly cached) hv ViewableElements to overlay (e.g., can compute segmentation on-the-fly, cache it using cachetools, return an overlayed contour)
    FrameStream <-> TrenchStream <-> CellStream, e.g., updating cellstream updates trench (if needed), which updates frame (if needed)
    moving TrenchStream also picks the first cell in the trench, Frame picks first trench in frame
    show right/left trench/cell arrow widgets below frame browser widgets
    trench/cell scrolling updates contour but does not change frame/viewport by default
    “Zoom to Trench” button sets x_range, y_range, frame to zoom in on selected trench
    “Zoom to Cell” button (in same row as Zoom to Trench) does the same for cell (using bbox for current frame)

###POLISH
fit shear in trench detection (this is probably what's limiting trench rotation finding accuracy)
fix qgrid column name wrapping
qgrid data wrapping
qgrid resize column width to fit data
qgrid UI to show/hide many columns quickly
qgrid freeze index/multiindex
some way of passing options through to sub-functions in processing pipeline? quick hack now.
bundle up raw intermediate results (e.g., ndarrays) in diag for easy debugging/running steps by hand (shouldn't take any more space to pickle because holoviews objects just wrap this data anyway)
compression/incremental loading/prefetching for regridded images+animations
only display/update plots that are open in plot browser

####################################################################################################################

###

use LRUStorageCache for zarr

parallelized ingest_nd2/ingest_tiff/trench_pack (NO QUANTIZATION)
ingest_tiff --watch

FUNCTIONS FOR MOVING TRENCH THUMBS/SEG MASKS ON AND OFF DISK
REGULARIZE (half-way normalize) trench intensity for sharpness measurement

SEGMENTATION
TRACKING
vectorize hessian_eigenvalues so we don't need to use map_ndarray on image stacks
rough hough with binarized image, then blur and intensity hough
ability to join runs of the same experiment (???)

#################

fix rotation: blur, do intensity hough, try edge-filtering first
blur trench profile, set minimum trench spacing

set of scatter plots synchronized to qgrid (bidirectional RangeXY), tool tips
SEE: https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/1600

STORE CHANNELS IN SEPARATE ARRAYS? new path: raw/pos_0/ch_1 (e.g., trench_crops/pos_0/trench_set_1/trench_84/ch_3)
ingest_tiff
ingest_tiff --watch (need some way of updating latest field, poll metadata?)
trench_pack
trench_pack QUALITY THRESHOLDS for trench detection, if it fails just keep whole frame unmodified (or quantized, if --quantize-trench)
trench_pack --quantize-trench/--quantize-fov (which keeps a quantized whole-FOV copy in pos#/ch0/fov)
trench_pack --crop-fov (for each trench set keeps only bounding box of all trench thumb corners, which can be combined with --quantize-fov)
inventory_data --formats nd2,tiff,zarr
PARALLELIZE ingest_nd2, ingest_tiff, quantize

mother cell endpoint tracking
mother cell segmentation mask
allow image viewer to overlay seg masks, trench thumb boundaries easily
fluorescent readout using cell masks

switch to pipenv on orchestra / FIX JUPYTER THEME (git repo/rectify with Bancroft)

REPLY TO HOLOVIEWS DEVS

fix pickling of diag_pos:
    make sure pickle isn't doing something stupid (compare pickled sizes with asized)
    compress/quantize/change dtype/crop intermediates (esp. masks)
    load raw images from disk
set up viewer for quick refresh of new data (just send new data to Stream)
fix none_pos
use trench_spacing to identify good/bad trench finding, use median (robust metric) from first 10 positions to constrain trench finding for rest of positions
refactor trench detection, only detect rotation once
per-trench and per-frame sharpness
per-trench and per-frame debris/QA detector
dataframe join with per-frame, per-trench metadata

rotation-invariant detrending
test detect_trenches on each position using max-stack, on a few positions using each timepoint (use trench spacing/rotation as benchmark)
look for brightest N pixels in trench cross-sections, show in table/next-prev browser so I can click and have viewer load/crop to trench
synchronize RangeXY of all images

POLISH:
alignment between kymograph pixel centers and sharpness plot points
pixel value live display
turn on wheel zoom by default
DWG overlay
