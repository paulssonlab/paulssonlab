SEGMENTATION
TRACKING
vectorize hessian_eigenvalues so we don't need to use map_ndarray on image stacks
rough hough with binarized image, then blur and intensity hough

#################

fix rotation: blur, do intensity hough, try edge-filtering first
blur trench profile, set minimum trench spacing

set of scatter plots synchronized to qgrid (bidirectional RangeXY), tool tips
SEE: https://github.com/ioam/holoviews/issues/1600

STORE CHANNELS IN SEPARATE ARRAYS? new path: raw/pos_0/ch_1 (e.g., trench_crops/pos_0/trench_set_1/trench_84/ch_3)
ingest_tiff
ingest_tiff --watch (need some way of updating latest field, poll metadata?)
trench_pack
trench_pack QUALITY THRESHOLDS for trench detection, if it fails just keep whole frame unmodified (or quantized, if --quantize-trench)
trench_pack --quantize-trench/--quantize-fov (which keeps a quantized whole-FOV copy in pos#/ch0/fov)
trench_pack --crop-fov (for each trench set keeps only bounding box of all trench thumb corners, which can be combined with --quantize-fov)
inventory_data --formats nd2,tiff,zarr
PARALLELIZE ingest_nd2, ingest_tiff, quantize

mother cell endpoint tracking
mother cell segmentation mask
allow image viewer to overlay seg masks, trench thumb boundaries easily
fluorescent readout using cell masks

switch to pipenv on orchestra / FIX JUPYTER THEME (git repo/rectify with Bancroft)

REPLY TO HOLOVIEWS DEVS

fix pickling of diag_pos:
    make sure pickle isn't doing something stupid (compare pickled sizes with asized)
    compress/quantize/change dtype/crop intermediates (esp. masks)
    load raw images from disk
set up viewer for quick refresh of new data (just send new data to Stream)
fix none_pos
use trench_spacing to identify good/bad trench finding, use median (robust metric) from first 10 positions to constrain trench finding for rest of positions
refactor trench detection, only detect rotation once
per-trench and per-frame sharpness
per-trench and per-frame debris/QA detector
dataframe join with per-frame, per-trench metadata

rotation-invariant detrending
test detect_trenches on each position using max-stack, on a few positions using each timepoint (use trench spacing/rotation as benchmark)
look for brightest N pixels in trench cross-sections, show in table/next-prev browser so I can click and have viewer load/crop to trench
synchronize RangeXY of all images

####################

plot browser: only update visible outputs (accordion state)

replace ingested/processed flag with finished flag

minimum spacing from smallest consecutive peak spacing
weight periodogram by peak height (?? this may be bad)

non-binary hough transform (??)
2nd, 3rd cell endpoint tracking, masks
UI
tiff metadata/sketch of folder watcher (“stream”) command

compute loading statistics (over time)

allow multiple accordion panes to be open simultaneously (see ipywidgets bug)
figure out why regrid(aggregator='mode') segfaults
revisit holoviews image axis inversion/overlay bug
fix bokeh toolbar/wheel zoom on by default

sublime remotesubl retry

command-line ingest/quantize commands (incl. option to only process first N)
auto LSF parallelization for ingest/quantize
auto-detect quantization level (need “natural image” vs. independent noise heuristic)

get rid of ingest_nd2_file
implement quantize_nd2 by allowing ingest_nd2 take a filter func
profile quantize

allow image viewer to overlay trenches easily
link image viewer to frame stepping widget
improve rotation detection/trench finding
mother cell endpoint tracking
mother cell volume mask
allow image viewer to overlay mean cell intensity/variance easily on seg masks
beyond mother cell tracking

spatial barcode warp/metric/clustering

unify process_arrays, process_attrs, ingest_nd2 so they can all share the same parallelization/remote execution/completion status tracking/progress bar infrastructure

fast/parallel nd2 to zarr converter, with progress bar (command line tool)

crosstalk composite
use fluorescent channel when doing lineage tracking

process_frames: register computed groups callback to compute on demand (TODO: use threading to store, return computed value immediately), provide require_computed, keep track of which (c, t) have been computed
LATER: need to handle versioning of computed callbacks

universal caching/storage layer (look up diagnostic/intermediate calculations, if not found, recompute and store them)

POLISH:
alignment between kymograph pixel centers and sharpness plot points
pixel value live display
turn on wheel zoom by default
DWG overlay

AFTER BUG FIX/WORKAROUND:
live-updating intersected point on thumbnail

NICE THINGS:
replace thumbnail viewer with full-size image viewer
stich together multiple fields in image viewer, toggle to use unified or per-field coördinate system
