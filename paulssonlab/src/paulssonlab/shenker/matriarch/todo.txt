replace ingested/processed flag with finished flag

dig into trench_detection internals in notebook
minimum spacing from smallest consecutive peak spacing
weight periodogram by peak height (?? this may be badv)

hack trench_finder with fixed spacing, narrow angle, verify it works for ~20 frames

look for brightest N pixels in trench cross-sections, show in table/next-prev browser so I can click and have viewer load/crop to trench
non-binary hough transform (??)
rotation-invariant detrending
mother cell endpoint tracking
mother cell segmentation mask
2nd, 3rd cell endpoint tracking, masks
UI
tiff metadata/sketch of folder watcher (“stream”) command

allow multiple accordion panes to be open simultaneously (see ipywidgets bug)
figure out why regrid(aggregator='mode') segfaults
revisit holoviews image axis inversion/overlay bug

sublime remotesubl retry

command-line ingest/quantize commands (incl. option to only process first N)
auto LSF parallelization for ingest/quantize
auto-detect quantization level (need “natural image” vs. independent noise heuristic)

get rid of ingest_nd2_file
implement quantize_nd2 by allowing ingest_nd2 take a filter func
profile quantize

allow image viewer to overlay trenches easily
link image viewer to frame stepping widget
improve rotation detection/trench finding
mother cell endpoint tracking
mother cell volume mask
allow image viewer to overlay seg masks, trench thumb boundaries easily
fluorescent readout using cell masks
allow image viewer to overlay mean cell intensity/variance easily on seg masks

per-trench and per-frame sharpness
dataframe join with per-frame, per-trench metadata
beyond mother cell tracking

spatial barcode warp/metric/clustering

unify process_arrays, process_attrs, ingest_nd2 so they can all share the same parallelization/remote execution/completion status tracking/progress bar infrastructure

fast/parallel nd2 to zarr converter, with progress bar (command line tool)

crosstalk composite
use fluorescent channel when doing lineage tracking

process_frames: register computed groups callback to compute on demand (TODO: use threading to store, return computed value immediately), provide require_computed, keep track of which (c, t) have been computed
LATER: need to handle versioning of computed callbacks

universal caching/storage layer (look up diagnostic/intermediate calculations, if not found, recompute and store them)

POLISH:
alignment between kymograph pixel centers and sharpness plot points
pixel value live display
turn on wheel zoom by default

AFTER BUG FIX/WORKAROUND:
live-updating intersected point on thumbnail

NICE THINGS:
replace thumbnail viewer with full-size image viewer
stich together multiple fields in image viewer, toggle to use unified or per-field coördinate system
